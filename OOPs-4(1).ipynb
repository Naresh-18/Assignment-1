    "The four pillars of Oject Oriented Programming(OOP) are :\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class. \n",
    "It allows us to hide the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world and only expose necessary functionalities through well-defined interfaces. \n",
    "Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding and abstraction, promoting a more secure and maintainable codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified and high-level view of an object or system while hiding the unnecessary complexities. \n",
    "It allows us to define the essential characteristics and behaviors of an object without getting into the implementation details. \n",
    "Abstraction enables the creation of abstract classes and interfaces, which act as templates for other classes to implement and provide a common set of methods to be used across multiple objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: Inheritance is the process by which one class (called the subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called the superclass or base class). \n",
    "It promotes the reusability of code by allowing a class to extend and specialize the functionalities of another class. \n",
    "The subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass, and it can also override or extend the inherited methods to suit its specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism:Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. \n",
    "It enables a single interface to represent multiple forms or behaviors. \n",
    "Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading (having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (providing a specific implementation of a method in the subclass that is already defined in the superclass). \n",
    "This concept allows for flexibility and dynamic behavior during runtime, making the code more adaptable to changes and easier to maintain."
