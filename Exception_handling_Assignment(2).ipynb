    "Using the Exception class as the base class when creating custom exceptions in Python is essential for several important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistency and Standardization: The Exception class is the base class for all exceptions in Python. By inheriting from it, custom exceptions adhere to the established conventions and structure of exception handling in the language. \n",
    "This consistency is crucial for maintaining a uniform and understandable approach to handling exceptions across different parts of your code and among different developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built-in Exception Features: When you inherit from the Exception class, your custom exception inherits a set of features that are available to all exceptions, such as the ability to include an error message and traceback information. \n",
    "These features make it easier to communicate the nature of the exception and diagnose issues when they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clarity and Documentation: By using the Exception class as the base, your custom exceptions purpose becomes clear to other developers who encounter it. \n",
    "It provides a standardized and recognizable way of conveying that your class represents an exception, making your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interoperability: Python built-in exception handling mechanisms and libraries are designed to work with exceptions derived from the Exception class. \n",
    "When you create custom exceptions using this base class, your exceptions seamlessly integrate with Python exception handling infrastructure and third-party libraries, ensuring compatibility and smooth error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extensibility: Inheriting from the Exception class allows you to add custom attributes or methods to your custom exception, enhancing its functionality while retaining compatibility with the standard exception hierarchy."

    "except SpecificException as e:\n",
    "       # Handle the specific exception\n",

    "       # Cleanup code\n",
    "\n",
    "''' 4. Avoid Bare except in Top-Level Code:\n",
    "   - Avoid using a bare `except` in top-level code, as it can make debugging difficult and hide unexpected errors. Catch specific exceptions or log unexpected ones.'''\n",
    "try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",

    "       # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "       # Log unexpected exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Log Exceptions:**\n",
    "   - Use proper logging to record exceptions and their details. This helps in debugging and understanding the cause of errors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",

    "       logging.error(\"SpecificException occurred: %s\", e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reraise Exceptions Sparingly:**\n",
    "   - Be cautious when reraising exceptions. It's generally better to handle exceptions where they occur rather than re-raising them higher up in the call stack.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except SpecificException as e:\n",
    "       # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "       raise  # Re-raise the same exception\n",
