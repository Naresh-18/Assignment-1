    " * Concurrency: Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, making efficient use of CPU resources and potentially speeding up the execution of programs that perform parallelizable tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Responsiveness: Multithreading can be used to create responsive user interfaces, ensuring that the application remains interactive while performing background tasks.\n",

    " * Complexity: Multithreaded programs can be complex and difficult to debug due to issues like race conditions and deadlocks (explained in question 6).\n",

    " * Resource Competition: Threads in the same process can compete for resources like CPU time and memory, potentially leading to resource contention and performance degradation.\n",
